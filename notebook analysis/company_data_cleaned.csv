3. Impact and Scope - The roles are brought and wide allowing for a lot of great projects to work on and stretch yourself. You can build amazing profile and achievements.

9. High performance environment.

10. Incredible collaborative tools and cloud solutions making collaboration amazing and easy. You can work from any device with easy.","1. Low Compensation: 
- TikTok pays WAY less than FAANG closer to Tier 3 companies. 
- No COL adjustment and only top performing staff get annual increments, based on “perceived performance”. 
- Only ex-FAANG employees are paid well and have RSUs. The rest are underpaid. 

2. Poor Benefits and Insurance - the benefits are below standard and the insurance is bad for a supposedly leading tech company. 

3. Poor Management and Leadership: 
- Many of the senior management are ex-FAANG ICs who are given huge portfolio in TikTok. 
- In APAC, senior leaders can be incredibly rude. 

4. Heavy Perf Review Cycles: 
- Heavy perf cycles every 6 months with low pay adjustments, if any.
- There is no clear guidance on what is high performance. 

5. Secretive and Non Transparent: 
- Nothing is shared with employees and most FTEs are treated like contractors with even basic business data kept private or not allowed to be seen. 
- No pay bands are shared or explained. 
- Leaders do not answer questions in town-halls. 
- The employee survey results are kept secret and not shared even with mid-management.

6. Lack of Investment in the Employees: 
- The company has no Talent and Development team 
- Poor training team 
- No education reimbursements. 
- No rotation programs are available, either. 
- No mentorship programs. 
- No communities 

7. WLB 
- It varies between teams, however overall it is intense. 
- Often you have to do 2 jobs at the same time with the low pay (see #1).
- Your calendar blocks and time is often not respected. 

8. Disorganised: 
- Very disorganised with re-orgs creating teams with no clear roles. 
- Frequent changes of direction, leaders and strategy. 
- Many overlapping teams and roles. 
- Mostly 2 months planning and very frequent changes. 

9. No Care for Mental Health - no insurance coverage or care of your mental health and how you feel. Management only cares about revenue. 

10. High Attrition and Decline in Talent 
- Attrition is high with average tenure around 1.5 yrs with some leaving in 2-4 months time.

✅ Remote working option
✅ Standard employee benefits like most tech companies: Health insurance (medical, vision, dental), food allowance (Deliveroo credits), gifts on special occasions (ie., Christmas, New Years), paid time offs, drinks & snacks at office pantries.","Disclaimer: Do not assume this is a China company culture or behaviour. This is simply an organisation that ruined their culture due to bad hiring -- this can happen to any organisation that lacks proper leadership planning, regardless of nationality.

❌ Compensation Package/Employee Benefits
- Salary is not competitive to other tech firms, yet claimed they've done research to provide a fair compensation package. 
- If you come from non-tech, you'll most likely be lowballed.
- Worst insurance provider (Aviva), what you see on the insurance handbook is not what you may be able to claim. If you escalate this to HR on call, you might get your money back, all depends on your luck.

❌ Organisation
- The company claims to adopt a flat organisational structure, but employees (ie., managers) like to play politics and ranks at work.
- Lack of a proper org chart for an organisation that has thousands of employees. - Inefficient communication paths between employees, departments & divisions - Lack accountability for actions or decisions at different management levels, hence slows down work and decision-making (everyone says it's not their job?)
- Copycats & lack creativity: Tries so hard to copy literally everything that the other tech giants do without reviewing if it fits the org (ie., Facebook, Google etc. Even office swags looked similar in colours and style?!)
- Core values are only for show or to mimic other tech firms. The leadership teams do not do what they preach.
- Power struggle among hubs that impacted work efficiency. Leaders need to learn how to collaborate together.
- Resignation process is tedious, apart from speaking with your manager and drop a formal notification, you are required submit an application on the app. Also, they may or may not pay the final salary on time.

❌ People
- Extremely toxic environment, people backstab each other or play office politics to shine. Rude & competitive, even when they're not skilled.
- Mass hiring for the sake of expansion, but literally ANYONE (with/without experience) can join the company, as long as you behave like a ""Yes Man"" during interviews.
- Job mismatch is the biggest problem. When they're not capable of doing their own scope, they do other team's work instead.
- A mix of candidates from fresh grads, public sectors, tech & private sectors for the SAME job level. So expect the inexperienced ones contribute nothing, but claim credits for everything.
- Workplace bullying committed by higher level management is backed by HR, they'll try to brush it off or blame it on the employees.
- HR & management level are pretty gangster, ""be candid and clear"" ONLY if you have good things to say. They take constructive feedback extremely personally and will most definitely ruin your performance reviews for as long as they can remember.
 
❌ Work
- A huge discrepancy between actual work vs. job description. Job mismatch is a norm here. 
- Plenty of manual & duplicate work, because not all hires are familiar with basic tools or systems commonly used in tech firms.
- Lack work life balance or unable to finish work within 8 working hours, mostly due to inefficiency, resistance to new changes/technology, manual or no processes to guide, lack of time management & prioritisation.
- No flight plan or job progression paths for employees to work on next steps. Performance review scores were based on favouritism not job performance. When being questioned, they simply cannot provide any basis of your scoring and will blame it on employees.",TikTok, Trust & Safety,"✅ Working hours: Flexible, great for working parents

- hiring is still discriminatory

- management is training staff to be delusional 
(they will tell you that company is doing well while you are reading news about shopee retrenching people and rescinding offer outside / they will tell you that work is dynamic when it's really just messy)

- to them, you are just a number
(look at how they retracted the offer from someone who just landed at the airport with his wife / look at how many people stay past 1 year / look at all the news about this company)

334,Strong headwinds ahead,2022-06-15,Former Employee,3,"- Abundant growth opportunities
- Decent compensation (sans shares)

Was a good run while it lasted","1) Bad business planning and lack of viable strategy
- Infighting between teams over resources and pointing fingers instead of thinking for the collective good of the company
- ""Strategy reviews"" or ""roadmap planning"" looks good on the presentation, but if you look at the details there are many loopholes/gaps and poorly executed
- Lack of strategic planning for long term when many teams are merely playing catchup or daily fire fighting, meaning capacity/capability/resources are always lagging behind business and needs (e.g. always need to OT, sacrifice weekends, always something ""urgent"" when on leave, burnout, lack of manpower & headcount just to name tip of iceberg)
- Systems capabilities far lagging and deprioritized - company does not invest in proper work tools and systems required for teams to work efficiently/effectively, require manual tracking/record/process that is struggling to support biz expansion/volume growth sustainably. incredibly alarming when you have a company so colossal (systems, people, processes, businesses) but still running on a startup infrastructure (e.g. imagine 48k employees and no org chart)

2) Weak leadership 
- Most of the senior leadership are experienced, resourceful and capable, but you are only as strong as your weakest link. Some questionable leaders in strategic positions that are not making the best decisions in the interest of the company's long term growth, but only looking at short term needs and performance so that they can aim for promotion
- Senior leaders not in touch with the ground/""reality"",  making a show of asking for ""feedback"" (e.g. townhalls, pulse checks, engagement surveys) but when feedback is given nothing is actually done to address the issues, after a while people just dont bother giving real feedback anymore cos whats the point right
- Many middle managers are promoted/asked to ""step up"" too quickly, even before they are ready to lead teams e.g. when open a new market in a new country, parachute a high level exec there to be country manager, but you need someone to takeover this exec's portfolio, so everyone down the chain is asked to ""step up"" and ""take on more things"" even before they are ready or demonstrated they are capable to do so. some have zero experience grooming/leading/developing teams, resulting in poor direction and (lack of) leadership
- HR programs to ""train new leaders"" not effective when middle managers are already so overworked, barely even have time to eat and sleep much less attend training programs
- pattern of favoring/hiring ""consultants"" is struggling to payoff 

3) Lip service to people/talent development
- company does alot of PR and marketing about developing talents but most of this is just paying lip service/only for public show everything looks great on the outside
- true that you get many opportunities to explore diff parts of the businesses because shopee is growing so quickly and there's always new initiatives/projects, but how supportive your manager is of your exploring these opportunities is a whole diff pic. 
- a lot of managers are under immense pressure from higher up to breakeven, demonstrate growth and take on more projects, they barely have time to slow down and guide/plan for their team's career growth and development
- HR trying its best to do ""L&D"" programs, but this wont work without actual, supportive buy-in from senior leaders. many leaders dont even engage or participate in their own team's team development/engagement workshop because ""too busy""/""back to back to back to back meetings""",Shopee, Manager,"- Abundant growth opportunities
- Decent compensation (sans shares)

- Many middle managers are promoted/asked to ""step up"" too quickly, even before they are ready to lead teams e.g. when open a new market in a new country, parachute a high level exec there to be country manager, but you need someone to takeover this exec's portfolio, so everyone down the chain is asked to ""step up"" and ""take on more things"" even before they are ready or demonstrated they are capable to do so. some have zero experience grooming/leading/developing teams, resulting in poor direction and (lack of) leadership
- HR programs to ""train new leaders"" not effective when middle managers are already so overworked, barely even have time to eat and sleep much less attend training programs
- pattern of favoring/hiring ""consultants"" is struggling to payoff 

3) Lip service to people/talent development
- company does alot of PR and marketing about developing talents but most of this is just paying lip service/only for public show everything looks great on the outside
- true that you get many opportunities to explore diff parts of the businesses because shopee is growing so quickly and there's always new initiatives/projects, but how supportive your manager is of your exploring these opportunities is a whole diff pic. 
- a lot of managers are under immense pressure from higher up to breakeven, demonstrate growth and take on more projects, they barely have time to slow down and guide/plan for their team's career growth and development
- HR trying its best to do ""L&D"" programs, but this wont work without actual, supportive buy-in from senior leaders. many leaders dont even engage or participate in their own team's team development/engagement workshop because ""too busy""/""back to back to back to back meetings""",Extrovert,Intuition,Thinking,Judging,traditional,ENJT, abundant growth opportunities  decent compensation sans shares good run lasted1 bad business planning lack viable strategy  infighting teams resources pointing fingers instead thinking collective good company  strategy reviews roadmap planning looks good presentation look details many loopholesgaps poorly executed  lack strategic planning long term many teams merely playing catchup daily fire fighting meaning capacitycapabilityresources always lagging behind business needs eg always need ot sacrifice weekends always something urgent leave burnout lack manpower  headcount name tip iceberg  systems capabilities far lagging deprioritized  company invest proper work tools systems required teams work efficientlyeffectively require manual trackingrecordprocess struggling support biz expansionvolume growth sustainably incredibly alarming company colossal systems people processes businesses still running startup infrastructure eg imagine 48k employees org chart 2 weak leadership  senior leadership experienced resourceful capable strong weakest link questionable leaders strategic positions making best decisions interest companys long term growth looking short term needs performance aim promotion  senior leaders touch groundreality making show asking feedback eg townhalls pulse checks engagement surveys feedback given nothing actually done address issues people dont bother giving real feedback anymore cos whats point right  many middle managers promotedasked step up quickly even ready lead teams eg open new market new country parachute high level exec country manager need someone takeover execs portfolio everyone chain asked step up take things even ready demonstrated capable so zero experience groomingleadingdeveloping teams resulting poor direction lack of leadership  hr programs train new leaders effective middle managers already overworked barely even time eat sleep much less attend training programs  pattern favoringhiring consultants struggling payoff 3 lip service peopletalent development  company alot pr marketing developing talents paying lip serviceonly public show everything looks great outside  true get many opportunities explore diff parts businesses shopee growing quickly theres always new initiativesprojects supportive manager exploring opportunities whole diff pic  lot managers immense pressure higher breakeven demonstrate growth take projects barely time slow guideplan teams career growth development  hr trying best ld programs wont work without actual supportive buyin senior leaders many leaders dont even engage participate teams team developmentengagement workshop too busyback back back back meetings,"{'Positive': 33, 'Negative': 11, 'Anger': 2, 'Anticipation': 22, 'Disgust': 1, 'Fear': 5, 'Joy': 7, 'Sadness': 1, 'Surprise': 6, 'Trust': 30}",33,11,2,22,1,5,7,1,6,30,8,59,Open

- PIC / Team created within the business just because no one is aware of how other departments can or SHOULD value add

1. Do not expect mentorship

Entered under the fresh graduate scheme but was treated as an experienced worker. Was overloaded with 10+ projects in my 2nd week without having proper onboarding and understanding. Fast forward to 3rd week, 20 projects. Colleague who was supposed to mentor and guide me, asked one of the intern to guide me what to do (intern was new as well). My team mates from the orientation camp asked me why do I have meetings during orientation. 

2. Whether the project is feasible or not, manager will expect you to churn it. Do not ask why.

For some of the  projects, I did ask what is the potential value of doing it - manager disregarded and told me to just do without explaining the potential impact. It was due to the pressure from the top - our dept requires higher target.

3. Exit Interview

During the exit interview, the interviewer was extremely condescending - perhaps she thinks that this is Google or Meta. Not too sure how many good reviews were implanted by their internal team.

All in all, this place does not promote career development, no mentorship and employs a high percentage of foreign talent. Company processes are very inefficient too.

For the first time in over a decade of private sector experience, I was told that Promotions are not related to job performance. Essentially, the job role has to be created, and the internal staff seeking a promotion via that role, has to apply. Then you'll be compared against several other external candidates.

2. The above is all smokescreen. It is nothing related to how much effort was put in, or even how impactful your work is to the company or her clients. I've been reprimanded more than once not for the work that i did, but that i didn't take the opportunity to network with my clients' higher ups(as a data scientist!). Clients can even write-in to say how much you've uplifted their business and all you'll get is a nice email pat on the back. It's all about visibility, the correct people knowing you, a lot of sales talk, and politicking with the right groups.

3. For most people, their role is basically to help the boss succeed as an employee(hey I'm an employee too?), you do their work, they front the engagement to clients and internal management, and yes they get the credit. 

4. You'll see middle managers who cannot move up for one reason or another(usually politics), start creating more layers of reporting under them. These additional levels of reporting serve no additional purpose, and just adds fiction and more powerplay into a typical workday.

5. Visa prides itself as an open and culturally inclusive workplace, but it really is a very US-centric environment. In any country office you visit, extroversion and (tactfully) speaking out will get you to higher places much. The quieter data scientists are basically reduced to pulling data and slogging over Powerpoint decks for years.

6. There are super talented engineers with PhD backgrounds having a hard time expanding their role within the organization just because they can't articulate the upsides of their invention in a way that make MBAs and business folk want to invest in their idea.
