No words can ever truly express the shock and grief the world felt on that day and for many that followed. Twenty years later, the greatest lessons of 9-11 aren’t rooted in the worst of what we experienced but in the best of how we came together to rise above the darkness.

I will also remember the resilience of our community as we vowed to rebuild and lift Lower Manhattan to new heights. Most importantly, I will always remember our 11 departed American Express colleagues, a tight-knit team who worked in the World Trade Center and served our corporate travel customers with grace and commitment. We honor those we lost and celebrate the kindness, courage, and resilience that bind us together and make us strong. #NeverForget",American Express,innovative

Products such as meat, seafood, ice cream and more, will be accompanied by a frozen water bottle instead of a gel pack used to maintain the freshness of these products. The 100% recyclable bottles contain packaged drinking water that can be used to drink, cook and water plants. After consuming the water, these bottles can be dropped in blue recycle bins found conveniently across the country.At scale, these small enablers will go a long way in contributing to Singapore’s sustainability efforts.As conscious corporate citizens, we are cognizant of the need to continuously work on our processes to use more sustainable packaging and this is a step in that direction.

898," We are proud to join the Billion Dollar Roundtable. Jason Trimiew and his team exemplify how we’re using Meta’s resources and global reach to promote economic opportunity.  At the end of last week, some of the Meta Supplier Diversity team had the opportunity to celebrate a very special moment: our induction into the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR). The 2022 BDR Summit was a chance to gather with colleagues and industry leaders who have shown encouragement and support to Meta and to me personally on our supplier diversity journey. Plus we got to join other newly inducted companies in ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange. As a member of the BDR, Meta is joining a small group of companies that commit to spend at least $1 billion annually with diverse-owned companies across their supply chain. The fact that we have reached this accomplishment in such a short period of time – we launched our supplier diversity efforts in 2016 – speaks deeply to our global team, our business stakeholders, our company leaders and the diverse suppliers we get to work with each and every day. Although we have publicly shared our diverse supplier spend since 2018 and remain committed to this transparency, joining BDR is an inflection point. We have clearly signaled that supplier diversity is aligned with Meta’s principle to promote economic opportunity, and we know we will be held accountable for our results. This is exciting! We have a saying at Meta that “the journey is only 1% finished”. This compels us, even when we reach significant milestones, to remember that we still have so much more to do. And this is especially true when the goals that we have are not merely numbers to achieve, but are fundamentally about creating more equitable outcomes and transforming disempowering systems. By supporting diverse businesses we can level the playing field and fuel growth. So even as we celebrated last week, we also planned. With our proverbial sleeves rolled up, it’s back to work because we are entering the next phase of Meta Supplier Diversity in which we go beyond. Learn more about our work and join the journey at Meta Supplier Diversity: https://bit.ly/3JOy1yQ #supplierdiversity #economicopportunity #BDR",Facebook,innovative

I interacted with a variety of different agency partners at Meta, and what really struck me was how caring they were and how genuinely invested they were in our business. Fast forward to today, I’ve spent the last four years supporting independent agencies across Australia and New Zealand, just like the one that kick-started my career. As a partner manager on the Global Business Group team in APAC, I act as an extension of agencies, partnering with them to grow their clients’ business and supporting them in achieving their overarching business goals. This includes up-skilling their teams, co-hosting client events or supporting their marketing strategies. There’s a poster at the office that reads ‘Nothing is somebody else’s problem’, which represents our culture of care, how we work with one another, and how we partner with our clients. For the small businesses we work with, we’re a lifeline and we see ourselves as an extension of their team.

Our team is made up of data and product analysts who are communicative, creative, and self-sufficient. In Tel Aviv, we support emerging markets, where many people are introduced to Facebook and the internet for the first time, which is an exciting challenge. Meta as a whole is very data driven and it’s one of my favorite things about the company, because I believe being data driven is the baseline of creativity. We’re given the autonomy to choose how we drive impact so people can have a better experience on Facebook, as long as we can support our decision with data.I’m also openly gay and a mother, and Meta is a constant champion for my community. It’s the most inclusive environment I’ve ever worked in. Both my experience and the data shows that diverse teams are better in finding solutions to big challenges and at Meta this is a core value. We make an effort to bring a diverse perspective to our work, and coupled with our love for data, it’s allowed us to be able to help billions of people connect and experience the world.” —Dan-ya S., Director, Product Growth #MetaCareers",Facebook,innovative

When I shared my news with my friends, several people asked me, ‘Why are you going ahead with this?’ While those sentiments made me worried about being upfront with the recruiter during my interview journey, I had a lovely experience. He was so kind, congratulated me, and assured me my offer wouldn’t be rescinded. I officially joined the team in January last year, and I gave birth to my daughter during the coronavirus pandemic. Though it was challenging to have a new baby and come back to work while navigating COVID, the flexibility and support I received from my team made it possible for me to focus on doing impactful work. The pandemic has been challenging for so many of us, with many people in situations they never imagined they would be in.

But after interviewing and talking with team members, I couldn’t believe how wrong I was. Over the last year, I’ve been pleasantly surprised to find that people here genuinely want to make the world a better place. We make decisions based on what we believe will help the most people around the world.As a product growth analyst at Meta, I have the opportunity to play a variety of roles. On any given day I can be conducting exploratory analysis, ideating product changes, prioritizing roadmaps, building dashboards, and conducting experiments. But my goal is always the same—to help the product team meet their goals and build features people love. I love the flexibility and ambiguity that comes with my job. Every day brings a new opportunity to grow and drive impact through a different approach. One of the most valuable things I’ve learned during my time at Meta is that you don’t have to wait for someone else to offer you an opportunity.

Joining a team isn’t always easy, and knowing this gave me great appreciation of the culture and community at Meta. Everyone is encouraged to share their unique perspective and participate in meaningful team building exercises designed to help us communicate and collaborate. Having this experience at Meta has led me to think about what it really means to be an ally. To succeed and lift each other up, we all need to do our part to cultivate an environment where everyone—no matter their background, culture, skills, or experience—can do their best work. As a leader, I’ve observed that our actions don’t always need to be big statements. They can be small gestures, like inviting someone to join in when they’re sitting alone or asking for input when someone hasn’t spoken up. Being a strong ally is really about our everyday decisions and taking the opportunity to make a meaningful difference whenever we can.” —Avinash P.

We can only answer these questions if our team is as diverse as the people we’re building for. When your north star is transformation, it becomes natural to think about the power of unique perspectives and collaborating across products, teams, and functions. We show up every day feeling excited to learn from people who are different from us to solve challenges and innovate.I see allyship as something that spans across everything we do at Meta.

As a leader, it’s my job to ensure there’s a wide enough canvas for everyone on the team to be their authentic selves.

When I think about what it means to be an ally, I always start with this. Allyship requires awareness and intentionality—it’s a conscious effort that, with practice, becomes a natural part of who you are and how you see and advocate for others.I’ve been fortunate to enjoy an adventurous and fulfilling career and as a female leader, and I recognize the tremendous privilege that comes with having a seat at the table. In my position, being a leader and an ally means doing everything I can to highlight fresh perspectives, surface different opinions, and empower everyone to do their best work. I’m committed to looking at those around me to see how I can lift them up so they feel supported and inspired to share their stories.

While I won’t be in Korea with my family this year, I will honor this tradition at home to commemorate the New Year.

We’d release them into the sky to let go of any bad luck and misfortune that could pass onto the New Year. After experiencing the impact of the pandemic, I have a deeper appreciation for living a normal and healthy life with the people you love and the ability to travel.

People love podcasts, and this has become a source of inspiration for many. Now my mission is to create this kind of awareness outside of Facebook, not just for the people who work here.Black History Month is a moment for reflection and self-education.

I take great pride in the success of ExxonMobil’s exploration efforts across six continents, where we’ve discovered hydrocarbons ranging from light oil in Guyana to natural gas in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Industry-leading exploration has always relied on identifying opportunities before others and taking quick action to secure acreage with commercial teams that benefit investors and the resource owner. And once secured, we must deploy the latest technologies, explore and appraise the resource with pace. It is also clear that discoveries big and small will benefit from a stable fiscal regime and partnerships that unlock value for the investors and local communities. These enablers, along with decades of deepwater exploration and development expertise, will shorten time to production. This has been a critical element in ExxonMobil’s success in Guyana, where we’ve made more than 20 discoveries and started production in less than five years from the first discovery.On that note, I would like to congratulate our ExxonMobil Guyana friends and colleagues for winning the WPC Excellence Award for Corporate Social Responsibility, which acknowledges our partnership with Guyana to build local capacity, grow their economy and support the local community.

I had a life-altering motorcycle accident in 2018 that left me a paraplegic and in a wheelchair. The accident happened one month before my 60th birthday. Being wheelchair bound, everything had changed for me. I felt like I was starting life all over again and needed to create a new identity for myself, one as a paraplegic. I rode my motorcycle in a safe manner and always wore my helmet. That helmet saved my life and set me on the road to recovery both physically and mentally. Today the helmet is used to show other motorcyclist the benefit of wearing a helmet when riding. People who have disabilities have their dark days – just like people who don’t. We work hard to fight through those days. It’s important for me to have a productive mindset. I try to do something new or different every day. Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I don’t, but at least I tried. It’s beneficial and important to share our stories with others. By sharing my story in this video, I want to show others there is “life” after a spinal cord injury. When mentoring other spinal cord patients, it means more coming from someone who lives it every day. I want to show them and others that just because we have a disability, we can still be productive and live a full life.https://lnkd.in/eaDJKtF9#GEproud #Inclusion #Diversity",General Electric,traditional

1394," On Wednesday GE Aviation's President and CEO John S. Slattery joined United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby on the first passenger flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). History was made as the aviation industry works toward the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  The vision for SAF is becoming a reality! Today I had the pleasure of joining United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby on the industry’s first passenger flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel, flying from ORD to DCA.  It was an important step in the #aviation industry’s march toward net zero carbon emissions, and it was significant for two reasons:  • First, we were able to gather data from the CFM International (CFM) LEAP-1B engine, which will help support defining industry standards for 100% SAF • And second, we aimed to raise broader awareness about SAF’s potential to cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% using today’s engine and aircraft technology — with no changes! Expanding the use of SAF is a massive challenge we can only solve collectively. Airlines around the globe are aligned on the demand for SAF, now we need to address the supply side. To do that we need sovereign support for incentives to accelerate investment in SAF production and to help close the price gap between SAF and today’s Jet-A. It’s increasingly clear to me the key players are aligned on the need to move with speed to make this happen — as evidenced by today’s flight, which included not just Scott and myself, but also our partners, including Ihssane Mounir, Vice President of Commercial Sales and Marketing at Boeing, World Energy CEO Gene Gebolys, and Dave Kettner, President of Virent, Inc. I’m particularly proud of the role GE played in making today’s flight a reality. It began with a conversation some eight months ago between my colleague Jeffrey Shaknaitis and his counterparts at United. As one of the founding members of GE Aviation’s Green Team employee group, Jeff is as passionate about decarbonization as he is about aviation. And through his passion, he’s showing just one of the ways anyone on the GE Aviation team can help drive meaningful change as we join together to invent the future of flight!",General Electric,traditional

However, there was a substantial decrease in viral load (in both high-risk and standard-risk adults) suggesting robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 & the strongest viral load reduction to date for an oral COVID-19 agent. Further, recent laboratory data also suggests that the oral antiviral candidate will be effective against current variants of concern, including #Omicron.",Pfizer,traditional

1977," I recently came back from a longer paternity leave, which Procter & Gamble is greatly supporting as a way to get to real equality in the workplace #sharethecare.  The long paternity leave was a unique experience, hence wanted to share a few reflections:1) The kids: the connection I built and deepened with both my sons during this time was much more than I anticipated (and I anticipated a lot). Mornings, evenings and weekends in a normal work environment cannot replace this. Full stop. 2) The couple: The paternity leave forces you to get into habit of truly sharing the care. Simple examples: How much clothes do the kids need for the next 6 months; who goes and buys what is missing? Which vaccinations shots did they already have; which ones are due when? Are you truly sharing these tasks 50/50? I have to be honest: the last weeks have shown me I am not supporting my kids as much as their mother does. Now at least I am aware and promise to improve. This is not an act of kindness, it is a foundation to support us mutually in our careers and at home. 3) Work-life integration: Work life balance goes beyond the daily and weekly struggle we all face sometimes. Having kids is an exceptional life event which does not return too often. Hence spending this valuable time with the kids will help you to feel more balanced later on when the day to day kicks in again. Nobody can take those moments and memories away from you or them. 4) Work: Ultimately it is not the company or the law giving you a paternity leave – it is your team. Focusing on getting your team ready for a longer back-up, being able to trust them 150% and coming back to see how greatly they managed, is a very rewarding experience. I am very grateful to them and will more often than before give them freedom and space. Net, we need to continue on the journey to make a paternity leave as self-evident as any maternity leave. The benefits are speaking for themselves in my mind. To all the (future) dads out there: you need to be a part of this and take your leave, independent of level of responsibility, workload, etc. If there are barriers, we need to actively work on how to overcome them. I am telling this myself as a manager of others as well.  Hope this is helpful – leaving you with an impression of the wonderful time with my even more wonderful boys 😊 #homecare #home #care #grateful #worklifeintegration #equality",Procter and Gamble,traditional

1984," Today I celebrate a profesional achievement with my promotion but also personal growth and a new step for inclusion.I dream with a society that offers same oportunities for People with disabilities and I will never hesitate to continue supporting inclusion for me and next generations. When I was a child I never imagined myself as a astronaut, actress or singer; my only wish was to feel me “normal” as all the people around. Unfortunately I never saw people like me in TV, magazines or business news, so I was convinced I did’t have a place in life.Without thinking I got my first dream of being Engineer despite my physical condition and I started the journey of my own inclusion; I remembered I was afraid of being fired everyday but also I knew I was asking for same conditions because my responsibilities were the same vs my peers. In this journey, in addition to my family, I found many incredible people who as my managers broke their own bias and are supporting my growth even over my own doubts.Here I go for a new Adventure!!Procter & Gamble **********Hoy no celebro solo un logro profesional sino un avance personal y de inclusión. Sueño realmente con una sociedad con el mismo acceso a las oportunidades para personas con discapacidad y nunca dudaré en luchar por ello para mi y para los que vienen después.Cuando era niña nunca imaginé ser astronauta, actriz o cantante; mi único deseo era sentirme igual que el resto. Nunca vi alguien como yo en tv, revistas o noticias de negocios; así que imagine que no era mi lugar. Sin pensarlo llego el día que cumplí mi  sueño de ser Ingeniera y empezó el gran reto de luchar por mi propia inclusión; a pesar de tener miedo todos los días de que me despidieran, estaba convencida que no pedia mas que lo que mi trabajo merecía. En el camino, además de mi familia, encontré personas increíbles que como mis managers rompieron sus propios bias y me acompañan en mi crecimiento, a veces incluso a pesar de mis dudas.

1995," Learn, Lead and Build was the theme of Procter & Gamble's 11th annual #PGSignal. This theme is a perfect reflection of P&G and our A&I professionals’ commitment to and action we take every day to discover business opportunities, delight our consumers with superior experiences and drive growth and productivity with media and retail analytics.  The combination of Human + Data + Technology is our winning formula for delighting consumers allowing us to receive the consumer “signal” that drives our success.  It all starts with our consumers, or the Humans we are trying to serve – the five billion people we serve every day. Human behavior and the whys behind that behavior are and will continue to be at the heart of P&G brand building. For us there isn’t a substitute for taking time to observe real consumers, in real contexts doing their everyday jobs. It generates hypotheses, inspires innovation, and sparks go to market creativity.  Data sets can help us understand consumer behavior on a massive scale and with greater precision than ever before. We start with the objective of using data for the purpose of providing a superior consumer experience. Our foundational belief is consumers should give consent before their data is collected and that this choice should be clear and specific and how we plan to use their data should be transparent. We keep the bar high, making sure that the data acquired and used is solely focused on creating value for the consumers we serve. Highly relevant to the innovation shared at Signal is Technology, which underpins many of the advances we are making in Consumer understanding, Media and Retail Analytics  to digitize and automate  the current processes, tools and models used to enable descriptive and predictive insights. In-home Sensors are enabling a much more specific and accurate picture of real consumer behavior. Augmented and Virtual technologies are enabling us to iterate on packages and shelves effectively and efficiently with consumers with virtual prototypes. Perhaps most profoundly is Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is truly bringing our vision of Human + Data + technology alive. As we leverage it to design, optimize and predict outcomes from product to package to communications the benefits in productivity across time and $s is exponential and the predictability is superior. This, too we know -  we have only just begun! Today we have the ability to understand our consumers and markets better than ever, when we bring together Human + Data + Technology. We are transforming the work of Analytics & Insights - learning, leading and building to constantly disrupt ourselves and our approach to analytics and insights in ways that lead to better consumer experiences for now and for future.  #PGEMPLOYEE, #PGAI",Procter and Gamble,traditional
1996," Partnerships drive change, and that change requires an integrated approach. With this in mind, WWF-Malaysia launched a partnership with Procter & Gamble (P&G) to support conservation efforts centered on the Malayan tiger within the Central Forest Spine (CFS) in Peninsular Malaysia. The 2-year collaboration, which started in January 2021, aims to help ensure survival of the Malayan tiger by restoring degraded areas and reconnecting forests, while taking into account the needs of local communities who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.After passing the 1-year mark, the project has successfully planted over 2000 trees, and maintained a further 25 hectares of existing trees. This helps to ensure the conserved area continues to be an important ecological linkage for large mammals like the Malayan Tiger. Another milestone is the completion of the land use maps and spatial mapping exercise. These maps will be used to understand the current land use and will be utilised for the strategies and development of the P&G supply chain, in support of their sustainability efforts.  With fewer than 150 Malayan tigers left in the wild, collaborations such as this are key to conservation efforts. In conjunction with Global Tiger Day, the recently released image of four tiger cubs and their mother in the wild, captured on camera traps, gives a glimmer of hope for the survival of these majestic creatures. However, we all must work together to ensure that these cubs continue to be protected and thrive, and ultimately, save the Malayan tiger from the brink of extinction. #malayantiger #conservation",Procter and Gamble,traditional

This year I am particularly proud of Procter & Gamble’s efforts to spark conversations about an issue many Asian American Pacific Islanders communities experience through our latest film “The Name”.  Belonging starts with a name. We are all given a name at birth, and it becomes a cornerstone of our identity. When that name is mispronounced it can make people feel like they don’t belong and reinforce bias. Our film highlights the importance of a name and how meaningful gestures like correct pronunciation can create a greater sense of belonging for us all. As parents, we put a lot of thought into our children’s names and how they connect them to our identities and communities. I go by Fama day-to-day but the name my parents gave me is Ma. Fatima, which in the Philippines where I grew up reads as Maria Fatima. Fatima is a title of Mary, based on a miracle apparition in a little village in Portugal. My mother always wanted me to grow up in the presence of my faith, which is why she chose the name. This is why it’s important to empower everyone to give and take pride in names that honor traditions, pass on heritage and reflect hopes for the future.Belonging starts with a name but it’s just the beginning. We’re all responsible for creating an environment where people feel they belong, are supported and have allies so they can fully embrace and be proud of their heritage.

2063," For Arvind Venkataraman, work at P&G is all about innovating for the greater good. Working on research and development for the Nervive team, Arvind helped create and launch the new nerve care product. “This has constructively disrupted the US OTC pain aisle to create an entirely new category focused on Nerve care,” he said. His passion for innovation stems from “connecting technology to humanity.” He calls it an exhilarating experience—the ability to listen to consumer needs, find the right mix of science and technology to meet those needs then communicate back to the consumer that we’ve found a solution. “Once the reviews/testimonials of the products start coming in, it is a simply WOW moment,” Arvind said. “It gives me deep gratification that we have been able to connect to something larger than ourselves and help people.” At home, Arvid likes to find connections between his work and his passion for cooking Indian food. “It is a lot of fun to understand how and why specific spices are chosen for every dish, what the order of adding spices should be, how much of each spice should we add. Arts and science come together beautifully in cooking, and it is enlightening to see how a well-cooked meal should caters to all five senses not only taste – similar to our products that have to deliver on multiple vectors of superiority."" #PGInnovation",Procter and Gamble,traditional

My project allows P&G to incorporate multiple external signals from distributors and retailers' inventory sales in our future forecasting logic. With the aim of revolutionizing end to end planning, my project empowers demand planners to leverage on external data to improve their demand forecasting.

Thus, I was able to pick up technical skills like PowerBI and KNIME Analytics Tool on the job which were very useful.

We’re driving a more circular economy through the establishment of #HolyGrail2, a smart technology that uses digital watermarks embedded in packaging to improve waste sorting for more efficient recycling.We’re working hard to create solutions that keep waste out of nature. Between brands and partners, we’re collaborating to find new ways to make 100% of our product packaging recyclable or reusable and reducing our use of new petroleum plastic in our product packaging by 50%. Head & Shoulders, Gillette Venus and Herbal Essences are just a few of our brands that are utilizing innovative technology and ideas to reduce waste.  We’re helping people reduce their carbon footprint, while we reduce our own. EC30 is a visionary approach to product design with solid, single-dose cleaning products designed by integrating ingredients into fibers rather than suspending them in water. EC30’s journey to carbon neutral is driven by a reduced number of ingredients – which lowers the environmental impact due to sourcing, zero plastic bottles and no added water, making it lighter to transport.Read more about how we’re innovating more sustainable solutions at https://pglifelab.com/.",Procter and Gamble,traditional

2201," For Principal Scientist Jennifer Gustin, her work is fueled by her personal life. Jennifer had been with P&G less than a decade when her son was diagnosed with Food Protein Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES). “The doctors at first did not recognize his symptoms and thought he had a bad virus. I did a lot of research on his symptoms and found that the pattern of throwing up in his crib about 2-3 hours after he ate meals to the point of dehydration was a classical reaction,” she says. Thanks to Jennifer’s diligent research her son was put on a diet to eliminate his allergic reactions and her work on the novel infant stool scale was published in peer-reviewed journals and cited globally from academic institutions and companies. Work with infants is still integral to her daily life at P&G. “My greatest accomplishment at P&G is the distinct honor to lead the Pampers Professional Hospital Diaper Research team,” Jennifer says. Her team creates evidence-based innovations that cater to a wide array of infant needs, from protecting newborn skin, to helping babies sleep or aiding joint and muscle development including brands such as Pampers Swaddlers and Pampers Swaddlers Pure Protection. https://lnkd.in/eAunH9Zc Research and innovation are such a foundational part of Jennifer’s personality, even her friends call her a “librarian.” Her degree in Chemical Engineering set her up for life-long learning. “I can be found researching, reading and collecting articles and books,” she says. “The breadth and depth of my technical curiosity is foundational to developing innovations, including professionally with seven patents and numerous patent-pending applications.” #PGInnovation",Procter and Gamble,traditional

2206," With paper, you've always had the power to launch new things to change the world. Read more from Astrid Teckentrup:I'm excited to work with our partner OutNature, a brand of @PreZero International, to change paper for good. How? By using Silphium fibers. Silphium is a plant that requires little seed, is particularly resource efficient, and protects wildlife and insect habitat through its long flowering period. Many farmers already use Silphium as an energy crop in biogas plants. Together, we have found a way to make the use of this plant even more efficient. We extract the fibers and make paper from them. This is because the long fibers in particular are ideal for papermaking. We are now bringing Silphium fibers to German retailers as sustainable merchandise displays. In our Gillette and Gillette Venus sales displays, some of the wood fibers are replaced by Silphium- with the same quality and stability. This protects and preserves forests. Together with @Thomas Kyriakis, we presented this paper innovation and our partnership approach to it at the German Sustainability Award. As we worked together, we quickly realized that we share a common goal that goes beyond Silphium: we want to take responsibility and influence industry and trade with sustainable solutions  Mit Papier hatte man schon immer die Kraft, Neues auf den Weg zu bringen, um die Welt zu verändern. Ich freue mich darauf, gemeinsam mit unserem Partner OutNature, einer Marke von PreZero International, Papier nachhaltig zu verändern. Wie? Mit dem Einsatz von Silphie-Fasern. Silphie ist eine Pflanze, die wenig Saatgut braucht, die besonders ressourceneffizient ist und durch die lange Blütezeit den Lebensraum von Tieren und Insekten schützt. Viele Landwirte nutzen Silphie schon heute als Energiepflanze in Biogasanlagen. Gemeinsam haben wir einen Weg gefunden, um die Nutzung dieser Pflanze noch effizienter zu gestalten. Wir extrahieren die Fasern und machen daraus Papier. Denn gerade die langen Fasern eignen sich hervorragend für die Papierherstellung.Wir bringen die Silphie-Fasern nun als nachhaltige Warenaufsteller in den deutschen Einzelhandel. In unseren Verkaufs-Displays von Gillette und Gillette Venus wird ein Teil der Holzfasern durch Silphie ersetzt - bei gleicher Qualität und Standfestigkeit. Das schont und erhält Wälder.Zusammen mit Thomas Kyriakis haben wir diese Papierinnovation und unseren partnerschaftlichen Weg dorthin beim Deutschen Nachhaltigkeitspreis vorgestellt. Im Rahmen der Zusammenarbeit haben wir schnell gemerkt, dass uns ein gemeinsames Ziel verbindet, das über Silphie hinausgeht: Wir wollen Verantwortung übernehmen und mit nachhaltigen Lösungen in die Industrie und den Handel hineinwirken. #Kreislaufwirtschaft #CircularEconomy #Sustainability #DNP14 #Silphie Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis",Procter and Gamble,traditional

2213," I’m excited to share that today, at approximately 5:07AM US ET, Tide took its first great leap into space laundry exploration aboard the launch of SpaceX CRS-24, destined for the International Space Station (ISS).  Once on board the ISS, Tide Infinity - the first fully degradable detergent created in partnership with NASA – will undergo a series of experiments to test the stability of cleaning ingredients under microgravity and radiation exposure conditions in space. The creation and study of Tide Infinity kicks off a series of detergent systems the brand is developing for NASA to understand the viability of cleaning clothes off planet. The end-goal is lofty and two-fold. First, help enable deep space exploration with a first-of-its-kind laundry solution capable of performing in extreme conditions of space; and second, apply the learnings from cleaning in resource-constrained environments to develop a superior clean in low-water, low-energy laundry solution for everyday use on Earth.  Tide Infinity’s liftoff today supports Tide’s Ambition 2030 commitment to decrease the environmental impact of a load of laundry while increasing the impact of clean clothes and furthers our mission for every load of laundry to do a load of good.

2245," Our CEO Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care Fama Francisco continues the conversation on #MentalHealth this month and highlights the importance of enjoying the small things as a way to look after our wellbeing. Read her reflections.  “Wellbeing is holistic, encompassing physical, cognitive and emotional health, and it is critical to our happiness and fulfilment as humans. Greater mental and emotional resilience and increased commitment to constructive habits have positive impacts.” - Tracy Brower, PhDIt’s true that there are many sides to wellbeing, there’s no single magic solution to looking after it. People ask me all the time, “How do you balance work and life?”. That sounds like a see-saw that’s almost impossible to balance! Instead, I like to think about my wellbeing as having 4 oxygen tanks: My 4 tanks are: My physical and mental health, my family and friends (who are like family), my work, and my faith – although they’ll be different for every person. These oxygen tanks can go up and down, and in my experience, they're never all at an equal level. But, I’ve found you have to be really careful to make sure that you can rebalance them when you need to. And most important, never let any of them get to zero! Taking the time to pause, reflect and take-stock is one of the ways that’s helped me keep my oxygen tanks running. There are many valuable lessons in Tracy’s latest article for Forbes, but what stood out to me is that almost half those surveyed said that in the past year, despite going through tough times, they’ve learned how to enjoy the small things. One way I’ve been carving out time to appreciate the small things is by keeping a gratitude journal. I’ve stopped the stressful habit of scrolling on my phone for news endlessly before bed. Instead, every night before going to bed, I write down one thing that I am grateful for that day. It’s the most positive 5 mins I can do to end the day. This small but constructive habit of taking a moment to take note of the day’s blessings and find joy in them has had a huge impact. It’s made me feel more present in what I’m doing rather than always thinking about the next challenge or day’s work, and when I’ve had a challenging day, it helps me keep perspective on the things that went well, and what matters. As we continue to take inspiration from #WorldMentalHealthDay, I encourage everyone take the time to think about our own oxygen tanks and appreciate the good in our lives. By doing these things, we can make sure our mental health is being prioritized so that we can truly be our best selves. As Tracy says, “The future is bright and we are rethinking, resetting and reimagining our futures for the better”. https://lnkd.in/dMkz4AX4   #wellbeing #mentalhealthawareness #gratitude",Procter and Gamble,traditional

2254," Great insight on #worldmentalhealthday from Fama Francisco.  This Sunday is World Mental Health Day. It’s an important reminder that while there are reasons for optimism, there’s much more that needs to be done.  We each have our own experiences with mental health. As a working mother of 4, I’m all-too-familiar with the many feelings of guilt, and trying to live up to my own unrealistic standards of parenting and perfection. Oftentimes, we end up putting our personal needs last, after we’ve taken care of everyone else. Now on hindsight, I realize that there are things we can do to normalize prioritizing our wellbeing at work and at home. For me personally, it can be dedicating small windows of recovery time to do things that I enjoy, such as cook a healthy meal or read uplifting books that give me bigger perspective in life. As a leader, it’s my responsibility to create a culture that encourages people to look after their wellbeing and to speak up and ask for help when they need it. Sometimes it can be as simple as asking ‘are you ok?’ and listening to the answer. I must be a role model in this space too, because the tone I set will empower our teams to make their wellbeing needs a priority. Small actions like encouraging colleagues to take their holidays, reducing the number of meetings and being sensitive to their start and finish times can go long way in helping people disconnect and recharge so that they can be at their best at work and, importantly, energized for the important things in life. Speaking up and sharing is also very important. I recently read Matt Haig’s ‘Reasons to Stay Alive’. In the book he writes about how talking about mental health can make you feel less alone.

In addition to strong policies that support the physical, mental emotion well-being of employees, the company is taking a balanced approach to flexible, hybrid work arrangements that vary around the world based on an employee’s location and jobs.Priya Mohan says balance provided by a hybrid work environment fosters wellness, something that’s more critical than ever. As human resources director for Feminine Care in North America, she has seen team members’ personal productivity going up with remote and hybrid work. “People are gaining more hours in the day to spend getting work done,” she said. “But we have to balance that out in terms of wellness, so you’re not sitting on your laptop in front of a screen for 12 hours.”That means encouraging team members to take stretch breaks or wrap up meetings five or 10 minutes short of an hour.

The partnership seeks to educate 1 million young people, parents and adults to help end bullying and eliminate cultural stigmas.Research commissioned by Head & Shoulders found that four in 10 people had experienced bullying due to their looks, 27 per cent due to their hair, and 36 per cent because of their #dandruff. Dandruff is a common skin condition that affects one in two people, yet misconceptions and stigma mean it can be a source of bullying. The research also found that as a result of bullying, almost seven in 10 13-to-25-year-olds lack confidence in their appearance, with 58 per cent going as far as to say they “hate the way they look”.As part of a two-year partnership with the Anti-Bullying Programme from The Diana Award, the brand will create a schools programme to educate one million young people, parents and adults by 2023. It hopes this will help to both end bullying and eliminate some of the cultural stigmas that are the source of #bullying today – with dandruff being one of them.Procter & Gamble",Procter and Gamble,traditional

2352," By 2025, approximately two-thirds of the global population is expected to live in water-stressed areas. People and nature around the world depend on local and regional water supplies to survive, and for many, water is their source of livelihood.  At P&G, we are always looking for new, innovative ways to protect the water resources that are vital to people and nature. As part of our Ambition 2030 goals, we have committed to protecting water in 18 priority basins across seven countries where our consumers, suppliers and facilities are most exposed to current and future water risks. One of these priority basins is within the Sacramento River Basin in California, which provides 35% of California’s water supply. This basin is a crucial source of water for millions of residents, wildlife species and acres of agricultural land. Today, almost 95% of wetland habitat has been lost in California’s Central Valley, and water scarcity throughout the state impacts the ability to deliver water to the people and ecosystems that need it. We're partnering with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation's Business for Water Stewardship program to support six water projects in the Sacramento River Basin. Together, the portion of these projects supported by P&G will restore nearly three billion liters of water in this essential watershed – the equivalent of about 1,180 Olympic swimming pools. These projects will also provide additional benefits to the surrounding environment, such as reducing the risk of floods and wildfires and improving habitat for local animals.

For babies born prematurely and their families, every touch can feel huge.

We are continuing to donate our smallest diapers, specially designed with the help of neonatal experts to be extra gentle on preemie babies’ sensitive skin, and we are also partnering with local organisations which provide dedicated resources and support services to preemie babies’ families.  To our Pampers teams, local NGO partners and NICU health care professionals around the world, thank you for striving to give every baby the best possible healthy start to a beautiful life, today and every day.#WorldPrematurityDay2021 #Preemies #LeadWithLove #MakingBabiesWorldBetter",Procter and Gamble,traditional

2443," Our Product Water Supply Sustainability Leader Kate Brown reflected on the moments that shaped her passion for conserving water and protecting our planet –  “I grew up surrounded by nature. My family vacations were camping trips including canoeing various rivers and exploring forests and caves. Growing up in a town along the Mississippi River gave me a great appreciation for the beauty and strength of water.  There wasn’t one “ah-ha” moment for me that sparked my interest to work in sustainability, more of a core feeling since my teenage years that my purpose is to help conserve this amazing planet and global ecosystem that sustains life. At P&G, I find our sustainability work to be meaningful because we have the reach and ability to impact more than 5 billion consumers globally. That is real, tangible impact. I love seeing how ideas become reality to save millions of liters of water. What makes me smile is seeing how employees embrace sustainability and bring it to life in our facilities. I have been working in sustainability for 13 years and never tire of seeing passionate employees succeed.”  In her role as Product Water Supply Sustainability Leader, Kate works with our manufacturing plants and other businesses to identify solutions to better manage and reduce our water consumption.

It’s specially formulated with an optimal level of melatonin, shown to help regulate your sleep cycle without next day grogginess.*  Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by your body’s pineal gland. At nighttime, your body begins to secrete melatonin to help make you sleepy. In the morning, your body lowers the amount of melatonin in your system to help you wake up. If you’ve been having trouble sleeping occasionally, due to changes in your schedule, new stress or just restless thoughts, you may want to consider adding melatonin to your nighttime routine.  ZzzQuil™ PURE Zzzs™ Melatonin Gummies not only have melatonin, but it also contains a unique drug-free blend of botanicals, like chamomile, lemon balm, valerian root and lavender.

Our latest ESG brief on disaster preparedness and response reflects how we continue to leverage our physical presence in communities to prepare for and respond to crises. Through disaster planning and preparation, we use data to help manage risks and mitigate the impact of disasters in the communities where we operate so we can continue providing access to the essential products and services customers need. We also work with response organizations on the ground to support hard-hit communities. Since 2016, Walmart, Sam's Club and the Walmart Foundation have provided more than $132 million for disaster preparedness, response and relief efforts in communities around the globe. Last year, our support included using our stores and clubs to coordinate services, in-kind donations to shelters and nonprofits and cash grants to emergency response organizations. We responded to a range of disasters last year, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Hurricane Ida, the December 2021 tornadoes in the South and Midwest and the July 2021 riots in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

2829," For over 30 years, National Coming Out Day has been a day to acknowledge, applaud, celebrate and dream.We acknowledge the struggles and difficulties experienced by LGBTQ+ individuals.We applaud the bravery of those who have made a choice to live authentically. We celebrate the progress made toward equality. And we dream of the day when we can all live our truth confidently with friends, family and at work.I am proud of the ways that Walmart aims to be a workplace of inclusion and to be an ally for LGBTQ+ associates. Recently, Walmart announced the roll out of Included Health, a healthcare-navigation platform tailored for the LGBTQ+ community that connects, empowers and advocates for its LGBTQ+ members. This is so important because research suggests that approximately 30% of LGBTQ+ individuals don’t engage with the healthcare system. This non-engagement can be so detrimental to our physical and emotional well-being. Along with Included Health, Walmart continues to create opportunities for open dialogue with Walmart PRIDE, an associate resource group for all associates (LGBTQ+ and straight allies). Platforms like Included Health and Walmart PRIDE do amazing work for our LGBTQ+ associates, but it’s important for all of us to be allies for our co-workers by creating a culture of respect and admiration for all associates. One way we get there is through storytelling and dialogue. When I share my story and I listen with an open mind and heart to others share theirs, that’s when we can begin to see beyond labels and connect on a real, human level. And that’s when the dream of living our truth can become reality. I’m proud to be part of a company that values all of me and I’m committed to helping every associate feel the same way. #teamwalmart #peoplemakethedifference #equality #nationalcomingoutday #juntossomosmas",Walmart,traditional
