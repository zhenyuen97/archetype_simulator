0,3 weeks ago," We were delighted to host Senior Minister of State Kiat How Tan to the #ByteDance Singapore office! SMS Tan met with our very own ByteDance tech talents and had an engaging discussion on ideas to develop local tech talent and grow the sector. Singapore is a key global node for ByteDance in our mission to inspire creativity and enrich life. We are excited to continue supporting the growth of the digital ecosystem in this dynamic region!  Growing up in a multiracial and multicultural country, Singaporeans are often better able to work in teams with people from different races and nationalities. This cultural adaptability has attracted multinational companies like ByteDance, which is the parent company of the popular TikTok platform to set up their key global node here. Had a good chat with the ByteDance tech talents on Monday, where we had a lively discussion on how we can better groom our local talents, and grow the digital ecosystem. I was glad to know that amid ByteDance’s rapid expansion, there is a strong and dynamic Singaporean core at their office. It’s definitely an exciting time to be in the tech sector. I look forward to meeting more of our tech talents and get their views on how we can better grow this sector.",79,1,0,{'comment1': 'Cong Zhao looking awesome!'},"{'username1': 'Patricia Yang, HRBP'}","{'job_title1': 'Chief People Ambassador Trusted to Build and Expand, From 0 to 1 #OrdinaryMind #AlwaysDay1'}"

16,2 months ago," Congrats to ByteDance's Intelligent Creation (IC) team in Singapore. A research paper co-authored by a ByteDance researcher and the National University of Singapore has been accepted by Nature Neuroscience, one of the leading scientific journals in the field of neuroscience. The paper is titled ""Meta-matching as a simple framework to translate phenotypic predictive models from big to small data."" Brain imaging technology is a key field in neuroscience. It can be used for observing the neurochemical changes in the brain during information processing and stimulus-response, providing an important reference for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.There is significant interest in using brain imaging data to predict non-brain-imaging phenotypes (the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism) in individuals. However, most prediction studies rely on very limited data, making them less reliable. The team approached this issue with a unique framework of ""meta-matching,"" or translating predictive models from large-scale datasets to new unseen non-brain-imaging phenotypes. ""We demonstrated that meta-matching can boost the prediction of new phenotypes in small independent datasets by 100% to 400% in many scenarios.""You can read more about the team's paper in Nature Neuroscience https://lnkd.in/dZJTp7xsAre you interested in joining one of our award-winning teams?
